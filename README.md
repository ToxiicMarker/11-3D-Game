# 11-3D-Game
This game is about an acorn which needs to find water droplets in order to grow into a tree.

However, I did not get to making the droplets and therefore a transition to the GameOver screen. I also did not add a transition from the TitleScreen to the game. The game area works and I spent most of my time trying to make a game area and importing in tree models.
